            <p> If you want to try how CURVE works, you can (deploy an all-in-one environment)[https://github.com/opencurve/curve/blob/master/docs/cn/deploy.md#%E5%8D%95%E6%9C%BA%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2].
                If you want to try it in production environment, you can (deploy multi-machine cluster)[https://github.com/opencurve/curve/blob/master/docs/cn/deploy.md#%E5%A4%9A%E6%9C%BA%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2].

            <h3 class="text-center">Features</h3>
            <p>So far, we have implemented a high performance block storage system, which supports snapshot, clone and recovery, and it can be attached to QEMU virtual machine or physical machine (by curve-nbd). CURVE has been served as an elastic block storage service inside NetEase for a certain time, during which high performance and reliability have shown.</p>
